## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple quiz app built with React. I used it to practice some more intermediate React concepts like state management with reducers and contexts. I also used it to practice some more advanced CSS concepts like animations and transitions. And used CSS variables combined with SCSS mixins to make the app more responsive.
